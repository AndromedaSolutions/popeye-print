**The Awesome Document Factory**

PopeyePrint it's just a bridge between the amazing WeasyPrint library and Popeye, our main project, which is yet not written in Python3.

The main reason of this little ****er is that we need to use weasyprint into that project, and we're still in progress to go python3.

Yet again, we need to use custom fonts and the default cli doesn't work with them, this fixes it (a PR should be created to weasyprint).


From a technical point of view, WeasyPrint is a visual rendering engine for
HTML and CSS that can export to PDF and PNG. It aims to support web standards
for printing. WeasyPrint is free software made available under a BSD license.

It is based on various libraries but *not* on a full rendering engine like
WebKit or Gecko. The CSS layout engine is written in Python, designed for
pagination, and meant to be easy to hack on.

* Free software: BSD license
* For Python 3.6+, tested on CPython and PyPy

**HOW TO USE?**

For anyone else external to Andromeda Solutions, that is useless, apart from that:

Create a virtualenv for python3.5 onwards, we tried with 3.8 and it worked like a charm:

virtualenv --python /usr/bin/python3.8  ~/.virtualenv/popeyeprinter

source ~/.virtualenv/popeyeprinter

pip install https://bitbucket.org/andromeda-sysadmin/popeye-print/get/51.zip

Configure in popeye, "custom.conf" a weasyprint_path under [global] to popeyeprint if does not match with the one in local.conf
